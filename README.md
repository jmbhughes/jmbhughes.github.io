My personal site built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and the [tabi theme](https://github.com/welpo/tabi).

When starting by cloning from GitHub, you'll need to initialize the theme by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`. You can later update with
`git submodule update --recursive`.
