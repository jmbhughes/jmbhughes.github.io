# jmbhughes.github.io

This is my personal website. It's based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) theme.

## Quick sommands

`hugo server -w` will let you see changes in the website locally. Get something you like, then push it to GitHub for building and deploying.
