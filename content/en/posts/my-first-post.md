## Welcome

Welcome to my new site!

## Why the transition?

I've been unhappy with how bloated my old website felt. It also scored poorly on Google searchability.
I want something that's easier to maintain and just a plain interface.
Enter [hugo-blog-awesome](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome).

## Accessing the old content

I plan to transition all the old content to this new format, at least all the old content that I deem
interesting still. Stay tuned for how that will work.
