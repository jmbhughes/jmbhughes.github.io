I am a computer scientist with 7+ years of experience.
I have a bachelors in computer science and astronomy from Williams College.
I'm interested in software applications in solar physics, including machine learning.
Currently, I'm working on building the
data reduction pipelines [for PUNCH](https://github.com/punch-mission) and [for CubIXSS](https://github.com/CubIXSS).

I am certified in:

* [Prefect](https://www.credential.net/1a76f801-37d1-4025-b368-481a15b0770e#gs.3d7pnd)
* [NASA Open Science](https://www.credly.com/badges/4d400179-8866-470d-b69a-867c92a71e53/public_url)
* [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/89UAJAX6PUUB)

In my spare time, I like
reading, sculpting with polymer clay, journaling, and many more things.

I also have an interest in developing open source software. Check out [barnsley](https://jmbhughes.com/barnsley_gui/), my tool for rendering iterated function systems.
