I had a glance through ["Realizing the potential of astrostatistics and astroinformatics" by Eadie et al. (2019). ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11714.pdf)While I do not feel qualified or informed to comment on the suggestions, I can summarize them quickly. There are three problems:  


1.  **Education:** Most astronomers are not trained in code development resulting in maybe good but fragile code. Similarly, most computer scientists don't have the astronomy background or connections. 
2.  **Funding:** Grants for methodology improvement are scarce. I wonder if these things can be funded from the computer science side of things in collaborations. 
3.  **Quality:** Astro-informatics lacks support of state-of-the-art methodology as it stands. 

I was much more interested in the final section about potential themes in research:

1.  Nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
2.  Sparsity.
3.  Deep learning.

I find the last theme incredibly broad and am unclear exactly how they mean it. It seems they're most interested in hierarchical representations of data. I would also claim that anomaly detection/clustering is important for reducing the volume of data.
