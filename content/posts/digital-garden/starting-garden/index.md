Writing blog posts regularly is difficult. They feel like a chore. I have an expectation that they should be a well-rounded piece of text (although you can see mine haven't really been). They don't link ideas together effectively.

Maybe I'll sometimes convert them into longer form articles that will end up in this section of the website again; I'm not sure.

I am going to use Obsidian Publish for now. I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for note-taking and journaling for a while. I love it.
