I've had a [500px account](https://500px.com/p/hughesjmb?view=photos) for some time, but I just decided to make
an [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/hughes.jmb/). I did it mostly to enter the Denver Botanic Gardens
Orchid Showcase Photo Contest, but I think it could be a fun way to share my interest in photography as well. I'll
be posting my favorite of favorite pictures at 500px, and then everything at Instagram. Hopefully, this means I'll take
more photos.
