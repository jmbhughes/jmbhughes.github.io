There's too much information to read or consume it all. We have to make tradeoffs. Burkeman suggests three principles:

1. "Treat your to-read pile like a river, not a bucket." You don't have to empty the container, just pick something that seems appealing as it floats past. 
2. "Resist the urge to stockpile knowledge." You don't have to take extensive notes or remember everything you've read. You'll still get impacted by it. 
3. "Consuming information is a present-moment activity." Enjoy it for now, not for some future benefit. 

I wonder if these posts are my stockpiling knowledge instinct.
