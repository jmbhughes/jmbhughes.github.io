> "The unstated appeal of a lot of productivity advice [...] lies in the bewitching idea that there might a rule, or a set of rules, that would force accomplishment to occur, rendering it inevitbable and automatic. We yearn for such a rule, not generally because we're lazy, but because we don't fully trust ourselves to get the right things done without one."

Even a rule as simple as marking an 'x' on the calendar each day we complete a goal is a fantasy conjured up to will us into productivity. I think there's nothing wrong with tracking your progress so you can have some kind of accountability, but the purpose of the 'x' is different then. The rules we use should be carefully considered instead of blindly adopted from self-help books. Then, they should be reconsidered as our practices and life situations evolve. The 'x' could be the solution for you if the regular recognition of a step towards your goal propels you forward. It isn't for you if you flog yourself every time you make a mistake and miss a day.

Rules and practices are tools to help reach our goals, not to solve everything.
