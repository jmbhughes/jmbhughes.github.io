A while back I bought a
[Samyang 135mm f/2.0 ED UMC Telephoto Lens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T48C3L8?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_3&th=1).
I had planned to try some astrophotography. I went out with it only once. I'd like to try again.

I searched the internet and found this list of suggested targets. They suggest using a star tracker, but [their suggestion](https://astroneticsdesign.com/products/astronetics-135v2?sca_ref=3424815.VbG8gLgHJH)
is discontinued.

I should determine what season each of them is best for as well.
