## Weekly Work Writings for 2025-02-03

Goal for the week: Close many of the open PRs and finish up the many open tasks.

### Monday

I learned about [the Space Packet Parser](https://github.com/medley56/space_packet_parser).
It supports parsing CCSDS packets from an XML format called XTCE.
It's an accepted standard that supports the CCSDS protocol completely.
I like how it's not as ad hoc. I'm interested in using it for future missions and parsing.
