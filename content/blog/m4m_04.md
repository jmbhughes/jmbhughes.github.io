Today's entry was about how we often measure ourselves by our accomplishments.

In particular, Burkeman proposed keeping a "done" list in addition to a "to do" list. I use Tick Tick to manage my tasks most of the time. It will automatically created a completed entry when I check off a task.
However, I see that as visual clutter and ignore it. I forget about the tasks I complete the second I complete them.

More than just writing a done list, I would benefit potentially from taking time each day to reflect on my
accomplishments, to celebrate them. It's easy to get wrapped up in the length of the "to do" list and never
acknowledge the length of the "done" list. I'm going to test out writing three acomplishments I most proud of each day when I journal in the evening.
