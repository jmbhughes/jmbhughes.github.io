## Weekly Work Writings for 2025-01-27

I'm going to start these weekly entries to track progress on work projects and get in the habit of regular note taking.

### Monday

Goal for the week: Improve pointing, distortion, and general pointing algorithms in Thuban
It should be:
- Easy to use
- Well documented
- Able to recover a distortion map from many images
- Handle the PV for AZP correctly
- Recover pointing within 0.1 pixels for PUNCH synthetic images with a demonstration of performance

### Tuesday
