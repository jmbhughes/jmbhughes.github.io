## Weekly Work Writings for 2025-01-27

I'm going to start these weekly entries to track progress on work projects and get in the habit of regular note taking.

### Monday

Goal for the week: Improve pointing, distortion, and general pointing algorithms in Thuban.

It should be:

- Easy to use
- Well documented
- Able to recover a distortion map from many images
- Handle the PV for AZP correctly
- Recover pointing within 0.1 pixels for PUNCH synthetic images with a demonstration of performance

I started outlining a new interface for Thuban, so it's less clunky and filled with a million parameters on each function. I also want the solver to handle all the cases (with or without distortion solving, etc.) in one interface.

### Tuesday

Not much to report. Continued work on Thuban.

### Wednesday

Started updating simpunch, punchbowl, and punchpipe to be less rigid. I want to switch over to using my own scheduler, mestolo, so I don't have to create a scheduler and such for every new flow/data product.

### Thursday

Soon.

### Friday

Soon.
