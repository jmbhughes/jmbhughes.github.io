In recent months, I have increasingly gone analog.
I now own a record player, stationary, fountain pens, paper cookbooks, and more.
The rationale behind this shift is best for a different article.
For now, I want to praise the Kaweco Sport Brass fountain pen.
It's a compact package that packs a big punch.

When you first see the pen closed, it looks so small and unassuming. How could something so tiny provide a satisfying writing experience?
As soon as you pick it up and feel the slight heft, you know you're working with something of substance.
The cool metal even has a lovely brassy scent to it. It's analog sensation at its finest.

Opening the pen unveils a clean fountain pen that demands posting.
My pen has a fine nib.
I might go for the extra fine if I were to buy again because I like narrow lines, but the fine works beautifully.

I love how it's developing a patina through use. I've been carrying it in my pocket and have had no leaking problems.
Having a pen and a Field Notes on me all the time is supremely convenient.
It pushes me towards paper instead of jumping to my phone for everything.

Such a fine fountain pen demands fine paper.
I typically use Rhodia notebooks, but I splurged on a Manufactus journal in marbled green.
(I'm still a Rhodia fan and use them for all my other notebooks. They consistently have good paper.)

Together, they make me want to never stop writing.
