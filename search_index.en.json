I did both because I wanted to make sure\nwe caught spelling errors even if a contributor wasn’t complying with the pre-commit.

These are the slides and handwritten notes. I plan to explore this idea further and write up better LaTeX notes, which I will then share as well. For now, the idea of atypicality centers around using two coders: one trained to perform best on typical data and one that is universal and not data specific. A sequence is atypical if its code length using the typical coder is longer than the universal coder, i.e. it is not favored by the typical coder indicating the information is somehow unique.\nAn example of the usage of atypicality from their 2019 paper “Data Discovery and Anomaly Detection using Atypicality for Real-valued data.”\nI presented on Elyas Sabeti and Anders H⊘st-Madsen’s 2016 paper titled “How interesting images are: An atypicality approach for social networks”. I think there are lots of opportunities for development in the image space, e.g. using different representations of images maybe including deep learning, exploring what made those images interesting by training a supervised classifier on the resulting labels and exploring the learned features. I’m concerned that their atypicality could be keying on background features, a lot more investigation is needed to understand the details of this application. I also think the image application needs more rigorous validation. They could have tested against other kinds of images to see if they also were labeled as atypical. One idea that was suggested by a member of our group (Amit Rege) is using the atypicality idea in a down-stream application to speed up stochastic gradient descent by picking atypical examples to learn from.\nA list of atypicality papers, by Sabeti &amp; H⊘st-Madsen:\nInformation theory for atypical sequences (2013)\nData discovery and anomaly detection using atypicality: theory (2017)\nAtypicality for vector gaussian models (2015)\nAtypicality for the class of exponential family (2016)\nEnhanced MDL with application to atypicality (2017)\nAtypicality for Heart Rate Variability using a pattern-tree weighting method (2017)\nData Discovery and Anomaly Detection using Atypicality for Real-Valued Data (2019)","description":"","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/atypicality/","path":"/blog/atypicality/","title":"Atypicality Presentation Recap"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/auto-sphinx-pdf/":{"body":"I have a project at work where I need to automatically build the PDF version of Sphinx documentation.\nSince our code is managed on GitHub, I thought it was easiest to use a GitHub action on each pull request.\nI tried several different pre-built actions but none of them worked properly or were maintained.\nThe final solution was to just install everything in the action:\nWe also install Mermaid since we have some Mermaid plots in our documentation.\nIt uploads the PDF as an artifact to the GitHub Action for easy download.\nIt certainly saves time instead of pulling, building the docs manually each time, and then inspecting.","description":"I created a GitHub workflow to automatically build documentation and upload the PDF on pull requests in GitHub.","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/auto-sphinx-pdf/","path":"/blog/auto-sphinx-pdf/","title":"Automatically building Sphinx PDF in a GitHub Action"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/automatic-suvi-youtube/":{"body":"Intro\nThe Sun is changing all the time. In order to identify interesting new events to study, a solar physicist\nmust monitor data streams observing the Sun on a regular basis. I thought it might be neat to make a\ntool that would automatically download extreme ultraviolet images of the Sun from the GOES-R SUVI instrument\nand then upload them as a movie to YouTube for easy monitoring. My goal was to use Prefect\nto run the entire process on a schedule. However, it appears YouTube has special restrictions on who can upload\nusing scripts. For now, I can have the video creation\nautomated but have to manually upload the video each day.\nCore Code\nBelow is the core of the code that makes this happen.\nWalkthrough\nIt’s easiest to read this code from bottom to top. You’ll see that the script when executed starts by calling make_suvi_channel_movie.\nThis Prefect flow handles the main logic. (If you’ve never used Prefect I’d recommend checking out their docs. I find them quite helpful.])\nFirst, we use a Python package I made a while back called goes-solar-retriever\nto download the SUVI images for a given day. We download them all to one temporary directory. We’ll open them one-by-one in the\nrender_suvi_channel_movie function to avoid overloading our memory with too many images. We can make one frame at a time.\n(You may still have trouble with this approach if you tried a long period of data because of how I used ImageClip from MoviePy.\nI’m not sure how much memory each clip consumes. Another approach is to write a .png file for each frame and then use a tool like ffmpeg\nto generate a movie.)\nIn the internal make_frame function, we do some fancy scaling of the images so that they look better. We also set each frame to show for\n0.25 seconds. With 360 images per day from SUVI’s Level 2 products, we can make a 1.5 minute video. YouTube converts any videos shorter than\na minute to the shorts format. That would be undesirable for us because it means you cannot scrobble through the video; you’re stuck watching it from\nbeginning to end.\nAutomating the YouTube upload\nAs I mentioned in the intro, due to restrictions from YouTube you cannot upload from a script and make the video public automatically it seems.\nEverytime I tried my video got locked for review. I believe they’re worried that spammers/scammers could upload many videos using scripts. It seems\nthere is a way around this, but it takes a special review that I didn’t apply for.\nHowever, if you had permissions to upload public videos there is a nice Python package called simple-youtube-api that simplifies interfacing with YouTube.\nIf you read its GitHub or just Googling around you can find instructions on setting up the needed credentials.\nBy injecting that task at the end of your flow, you could upload the videos automatically.\nExtending with thematic maps\nWe can extend the code above to generate thematic map movies from SUVI as well. The thematic map product identifies what different phenomena are present on the Sun,\ne.g. bright regions, coronal holes, filaments. You can read more about my thematic map work in this press release\nor in this paper. The image below shows a three-color composite of SUVI images\non the left and a thematic map on the right. Yellow, for example, are bright regions while green are coronal holes.\nThe code gets a bit more complicated because the thematic maps neede to be rendered with a specific color table.\nI added a utility build_thmap_cmap to help with this process.\nCode for thematic maps\nResults and future improvements\nYou can see the first such movie I created at this YouTube video. The colormap could be\nchanged to match the standard SUVI colormaps. It also doesn’t have high enough contrast in my opinion. But it’s a first step.\nI would like to continue this line of automated visualization and include other detection algorithms. For example, it would be cool\nto be able to identify all the bright points on the Sun over the course of a day, analyze their properties, and output a result chart.","description":"","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/automatic-suvi-youtube/","path":"/blog/automatic-suvi-youtube/","title":"Automating SUVI YouTube"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/axis-aligned-artifacts/":{"body":"There are artifacts created by choosing axis aligned cuts in robust random cut forests, similar to what was noted with IsoForest..\nLeft: Original data distribution.

You can access it via the website or by building it yourself from source. You can find the source code for the library and for the graphical user interface(GUI) on GitHub. The GUI is currently implemented using Rust’s egui. Let’s back up a bit though.\nWhat is an iterated function system?\nAn iterated function system or IFS is a formal mathematical structure. More technically, it’s a set of contractive mappings. They can be used to generate fractals. Fractals are never ending, repeating, mathematical patterns. They occur in nature a lot actually. Trees, lightning, and galaxies all exhibit some fractal patterns. We won’t go into great detail of the math in this article, maybe a future aricle will.\nI think of an IFS as a set of “transforms” that each have weights and properties. When evaluating an IFS, we will generate a bunch of random points. A transform is just an instruction that tells you how to convert one point to the next one. For example, a transform might say that if you’re at the center of an image you should then jump to the right. I’ve implemented four transforms so far in Barnsley: Linear, Affine, Inverse Julia, and Moebius. They each have a different mathematically form and thus different parameters to adjust.\nMathematical descriptions of the transforms\nFeel free to skip this section if you want to avoid math.\nLinear\nThe Linear transform has four real parameters: $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. It takes a point $(x, y)$ and mutates it to $$(ax + by, cx + dy)$$\nAffine\nThe Affine transform has six real parameters: $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $\\mathrm{xshift}$, and $\\mathrm{yshift}$. It takes a point $(x,y)$ and mutates it to $$(ax + by + \\mathrm{xshift}, cx + dy + \\mathrm{yshift})$$\nMoebius\nThe Moebius transform has four complex parameters: $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. It takes a point $(x, y)$ and defines a complex $z_1 = a + bi$ . We then calculate $$z_2 = \\frac{a * z_1 + b}{c * z_1 + d}$$. It ultimately mutates the point to $$(\\Re(z_2), \\Im(z_2))$$ where $\\Re(z_2)$ is the real part of $z_2$ and $\\Im(z_2)$ is the imaginary part of $z_2$.\nInverse Julia\nThe Inverse Julia transform has two real parameters: $r$ and $\\theta$. It’s the most complicated transform computationally. It takes a point $(x, y)$ and mutates it by first defining $c = r \\cos{\\theta} + (r \\sin{\\theta})i$. We let $z = x + yi$. Then, $z_2 = c - z$. $\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{atan2}(\\Im(z_2), \\Re(z_2))}{2}$ where $\\Re(z_2)$ is the real part of $z_2$ and $\\Im(z_2)$ is the imaginary part of $z_2$. Further,\n$$\n\\mathrm{atan2} (y,x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\arctan \\left({\\frac {y}{x}}\\right )&amp; \\text{if } x&gt;0 \\ \\newline\n\\frac {\\pi }{2} -\\arctan{\\frac {x}{y}} &amp; \\text{if }y&gt;0 \\ \\newline\n-\\frac {\\pi }{2}-\\arctan{\\frac {x}{y}} &amp; \\text{if }y&lt;0 \\ \\newline\n\\arctan{\\frac {y}{x}} \\pm \\pi &amp; {\\text{if }}x&lt;0 \\ \\newline\n\\text{undefined} &amp; \\text{if }x=0\\text{ and }y=0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe let $k = -1$ with $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability and $k = 1$ with $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability so that\n$\ns = k \\sqrt{\\Im(z_2) * \\Im(z_2) + \\Re(z_2) * \\Re(z_2)}\n$\nFinally, $(x, y)$ becomes $$(s \\cos{\\theta_2}, s \\sin{\\theta_2})$$\nIt’s not a simple one, but it’s powerful.\nAdditional parameters\nIn addition to the mathematical parameters, each transform has a weight and a color. The weight is used when randomly picking the next transform. Higher weight means it’s more likely to be chosen. The color is blended into the point in each iteration.\nHow to use the tool\nThe website is hopefully straight forward to use. It has the same layout as if you installed the tool on your machine. Note that the website doesn’t currently support mobile devices though. For using the tool on a computer, either through the website or installation, see the tricks below.\nCreate section\nIn the “Create” section of the tool, there are a few buttons: randomize, open parameters, save image, and save parameters. Randomize is a fun way to adjust all the parameters in the IFS’s transforms at once. It doesn’t add or remove transforms though, so if you want to dramatically change the quality of the IFS I’d recommend adding or deleting transforms first. Then, randomize to your heart’s content to get different examples.\nOnce you have found a good IFS, you can save the image as a PNG file and/or save the parameters to a JSON file. I’ve been annoyed that the file prompt doesn’t seem to suggest the file extension in the web browser. Thus, when you save an image you have to put a “.png” on the end of the filename. When you save parameters, you should similarly put “.json” as the extension.\nIf you want to return to an IFS later, you must save the parameters. When you refresh, it’ll be reset. If you’ve saved the parameters, you can use the open parameters button to select the JSON file you created and revisualize the transform though.\nAdjusting generation properties\nUnder the “Generation controls” section of the tool, you will see the capability to adjust the image height, image width, the number of points generated in each image, and the number of iterations for each point. Note that changing the number of points or number of iterations could slow down the generation. I find it’s nice to start with them set low until I find an interesting transform and then crank them up to make the image quality more impressive.\nMutating parameters\nBy mutating the parameters, you can step smoothly between iterated function systems. We can start with a system that looks like the left and mutate parameters slowly to get to the right.\nTo do this, you just open one of the Transforms and more the slider slowly while saving in between steps.\nSuch a smooth transition indicates we might be able to make cool animations. See below for some examples and the plans to add the capability to the tool.\nAdding transforms\nAt the moment, there are only four transform types implemented as described earlier in this article. You can add any of them. If you want to delete one later, you can open that transform in the transforms section and click the delete button.\nTwo cool results\nThere are lots of cool images you can create. One of my favorites is:\nI’ve started using that one as a profile picture in a few places.\nYou can also generate known fractals, like the Sierpinski Triangle:\nAnimations\nOne thing that isn’t in the tool yet is generating animations. I’ve started playing around with it though. See some examples:\nFuture plans\nI hope to continue developing the application. I may convert away from the egui frontend because it’s a bit tedious and not as aesthetically appealing as I’d like. I also want to implement the animation interface so you can visualize animations in the tool easily and save movies. There’s a fair bit of tech debt in the codebase too. I’ve hackishly done many things and realized better ways to do them later. This was a Rust learning project afterall. So, I’ll likely try rewriting the codebase and releasing a more stable version that is cleaner.

It’s as wild and fun as it sounds. I’d recommend watching it. At the same time, I was in the process of buying a house in a wooded area. I was captivated by the hummingbirds when I toured the house the first time. The gears turned in my mind linking the video and the house, and I knew I wanted to try understanding the birds around my new house. In the video Benn Jordan describes various set ups, and I decided the fastest route to get going was this AudioMoth setup. So what is an AudioMoth?\nRipped straight from the OpenAcoustics website:\nAudioMoth is a low-cost, full-spectrum acoustic logger, based on the Gecko processor range from Silicon Labs. Just like its namesake the moth, AudioMoth can listen at audible frequencies, well into ultrasonic frequencies. It is capable of recording uncompressed audio to microSD card at rates from 8,000 to 384,000 samples per second and can be converted into a full-spectrum USB microphone.\nHow I set up my system?\nI bought the AudioMoth from GroupGets for $100 and the IPX7 waterproof case for it for an additional $45. I grabbed a micro SD card and was off to the races. It’s that simple. Throw some batteries and a card in it, and you can get started recording.\nAs a first experiment, I used the default settings and got some huge 4 gigabyte recording files. I had neglected to read any setup documents and was still able to capture something. The timestamps were all wrong on the files though, and it was a bit unwieldy at that size. So, I stepped back and read the setup guides and ran the setup configurator. I didn’t really change anything from the default in the setup configurator. With those few changes, I had proper timestamps (hooray!) and recorded 55 seconds of every minute into separate WAV files. Magic!\nI selected a tree farther from the house and strapped it to a low limb. I left it to record for a bit.\nWhat are my first results?\nI had 2,543 recordings after that first session. Here’s the recording for one moment with some Pygmy Nuthatches:\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\nIt’s hanging out on the tree as I type now, so I’m getting thousands of more recordings. That’s too much audio to manually comb through. Enter machine learning and BirdNET! BirdNET is a machine learning model from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology that detects birds just by audio.\nLabeling the audio\nEven better, there’s a Python package that makes using BirdNET trivial. I simply pip install birdnet and was ready to classify. All my first audio lives in one folder on my computer, so I followed the package instructions and ran the following script:\nI now had a spreadsheet that classified the bird species for each three second snippet in each file.\nYou can see in the picture it starts with human voice because I was talking to a friend before putting it out on the tree. If I scroll down in the spreadsheet, I start seeing bird species with their confidences. I listened to some recordings and used my knowledge of local bird sounds to see if the labels made sense. The ones with high confidence scores seemed plausible.\nFirst pass at plotting\nI was ecstatic that I could go from audio to labels that easily. It was time to start analyzing the data! I wrote a quick script that loaded that spreadsheet and rendered a quick plot:\nThat resulted in a plot like this:\nIt’s a bit of an ugly plot. We’ll solve that later, but for now let’s bask in the glory of bird sound time series! From experience watching the birds at my house, I expected Clark’s Nutcrackers, Pygmy Nuthatches, Mountain Chickadees, and Steller’s Jays. I had seen a few woodpeckers, but they were rare sights at my feeders, so I was happy to pick them up too. The surprise was the Flammulated Owl. I’m not convinced I actually have one. When I listen to the audio, it sounds like dogs barking. It’s not like the recordings I find online. So, we’ll have to follow up more on that.\nI haven’t shown it on the plot here, but BirdNET also labeled some clips as coyote sounds. They’re eerie to hear. Here’s a clip:\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\nThere were lots of other birds that got excluded by my 0.8 confidence and &gt;10 count filtering. It’s possible some of them are real, but for now I’m looking for the obvious and clean signal. Later, I want to dive into the possible rare signals and see if I can distinguish them from mislabeling.\nConverting to a heat map\nI took the code from before and appended a bit more to make a heat map of the bird sounds.\nIt’s a bit easier to digest than the line graph because they don’t overlap as much. Darker lines indicate when there were more of that bird call.\nMaking clock plots\nI want to answer questions I have about bird behavior instead of just plotting a long time series. I started with a simple question: what time of day is a certain species most active? To answer this question, we can make what I’m calling 24-hour clock plots. They’re polar plots where the fractional frequency is aggregated over the time of day instead of the full time.\nWe can readily see the Nuthatches are most active around 8am (according to this very limited data set).\nWe can compare that to the Clark’s Nutcrackers and the (possible detection) of Flammulated Owls:\nObviously for reliable understanding of behavior I’ll need more data, but it’s an exciting start.\nWhat are my future plans?\nSo where am I headed with this project? I’d like to understand and answer many more questions about the birds on my property:\nWhat birds are present in other seasons?\nDo I have specific birds that migrate through the property at certain times?\nDoes the presence of one bird species indicate another will be more silent? Or who chirps with who? Or does a Steller’s Jay scare away smaller birds for a bit?\nHow does schedule for bird song for a species change throughout the year?\nAre there any bird species in my yard I haven’t seen with my eyes, like the Flammulated Owl?\nDo different spots on my property attract different kinds of birds? Some spots have different trees after all.\nIs bird behavior correlated with the weather in a given season? When it’s rainy or cold are birds quieter?\nSo many more questions!\nI might be able to Google the answer to some of these questions, but where is the fun in that?\nHopefully this is just the first of many bird posts! It’s such a rewarding hobby.\nI plan to organize and open source all my code eventually. For now, enjoy this Pygmy Nuthatch photo.","description":"I bought an AudioMoth microphone and have started identifying the birds by sound on my property.","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/bird1/","path":"/blog/bird1/","title":"Birding with an AudioMoth: Setup and First Results"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/converting-coordinates/":{"body":"Introduction\nSolar physics and nighttime astronomy often use different but related coordinate systems.\nIn solar physics, the helioprojective coordinate system is common. Depending on the subfield\nof astronomy one might use a variety of coordinate systems, but one of the most common is equatorial.\nThese are both spherical geometries.\nHowever, it turns out to be a bit complicated to convert directly between the two. Astropy and SunPy\noffer utilities to do the conversion, but I was running into some challenges. I asked Sam Van Kooten for\nhelp, and we came up with this solution. It only applies when the observer is the center of the Earth though.\nConverting a single coordinate\nFirst, we need to know how to convert a single coordinate.\nAstropy has a system of transormations that form a computational graph. SunPy augments this with the\ncommon solar coordinate systems. If we try to convert helioprojective to GCRS, we’ll be doing several\nsteps of conversions: Helioprojective to Heliocentric to HeliographicStonyhurst to HCRS to ICRS and finally to GCRS.\nThis shouldn’t really be required. So, we’ll register a new transformation that goes from helioprojective straight to GCRS.\nThe meat of the transformation happens when setting up the matrices in the last function.\nThey’re rotation matrices to go from one to the other using the Sun’s right ascension and declination coupled with the solar P angle.\nWe carefully use the P angle in GCRS instead of SunPy’s built-in sun.P, which I believe uses ITRS.\nWe can then use Astropy’s infrastructure for conversions.\nIt’s quite nifty.\nTransforming a WCS from helio to celestial\nSo let’s say you have a world coordinate system in helioprojective. How can you use this to convert to GCRS?\nFirst, you transform the CRVAL using the coordinate transform we just defined.\nThen, you transform the PC matrix by rotating by the P angle.\nSince this code was developed for PUNCH, we have a polarization axis that makes this WCS 3D in some cases.\nSo, we handle that here too.\nTransforming the opposite direction\nYou can reverse this too!\nVerifying\nWe have many tests to verify this works properly.\nWe use the Sun’s position to go back and forth with known coordinates.\nWe also test that given an arbitrary WCS you can convert to the other system and then convert back and\nget the original input. All our tests pass.\nConclusions\nThis code was developed for PUNCH to go back and forth between helioprojective and GCRS.\nIt was used to create some synthetic images that are like what PUNCH will see.\nThose files include both a helioprojective and equatorial WCS so you can locate things in context of\nthe Sun and the stars.\nHere’s a sneak peak of what these images look like.\nI’ll write more about the synthetic images in the future.","description":"Change between world coordinate systems using Astropy and SunPy","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/converting-coordinates/","path":"/blog/converting-coordinates/","title":"Converting helioprojective to equatorial"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/crash-course-in-rust/":{"body":"These slides are from a while back, but I didn’t want to lose them.","description":"Slides I gave about getting started in Rust.","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/crash-course-in-rust/","path":"/blog/crash-course-in-rust/","title":"Crash Course in Rust"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/dash2024/":{"body":"Below are my DASH 2024 slides:\nAlso available through Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/13925458","description":"Slides for the 2024 meeting of Data, Analysis, and Software in Heliophysics conference","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/dash2024/","path":"/blog/dash2024/","title":"DASH 2024"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/denoising-autoencoder/":{"body":"How do you denoise images with an autoencoder if you don’t have a clean version to train with? One option is to add more noise to your images! In this experiment, I trained an autoencoder with noisy MNIST data. I began with MNIST images on the bottom row, the noiseless versions. To simulate observational data, I added Gaussian noise to the images. In reality, we may never have access to these noiseless images. To train an autoencoder we need an input set with noise and output set without noise so the autoencoder can learn the denoising procedure. An autoencoder could potentially also learn the denoising procedure if we gave it extra noisy images as input and slightly denoised images as output. To simulate this, I added more Gaussian noise to the observations to arrive at the top row. Then, the top row is input and the second row is the output for training. When we want to denoise observations, we use this trained network with the observations as input and the denoised row as our output.\nI am not sure how sensitive this is to an accurate noise model when adding noise or the amount of noise added. In the solar extreme ultraviolet setting, we suffer more from shot/Poisson noise than Gaussian noise. I am unsure how well this approach works under that setting.\nAn arguably more elegant approach to this problem is the “Blind Denoising Autoencoder” by Majumdar (2018).

One of my students is taking\nAP Computer Science at the same time. His teacher requires all the students to\ncomplete a final project of their choosing; they have complete freedom in\npicking the project except it has to be approved by the teacher. (That sounds\nlike an awesome teacher by the way, encouraging students to learn on their own\nby pursuing their own passion projects. That’s how you really learn.)\nI’ve been teaching machine learning to this particular student, so we started\nbrainstorming ML projects. Ultimately, he wanted to use a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) to generate fake space pictures. We were inspired by\nseveral\nother\nprojects conducted by professional\nastronomers and computer scientists and reported in the academic literature.\nI was excited by this project because it unites two of my passions: machine learning\nand astronomy.\nWe decided the project would use images from NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).\nThey are, after all, some of the best images of our universe!\nWe outlined the project in a few steps:\nTeach him about how GANs work\nImplement a basic GAN on a common dataset like MNIST\nScrape APOD for all pictures that meet our criteria\nTrain a sophisticated GAN to fake APOD!\nI won’t go into too much detail about steps 1 and 2 here and focus most on\nsteps 3 and 4.\nScraping APOD\nIt turns out getting images from APOD is easier than I expected. Our initial\napproach was to parse the archive\nas a jumping off point. However, we quickly noticed that all the links had a\nstandard form. To get the image from May 25th, 2022 you simply go to\nhttps://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220525.html. The URL is just ap followed by\na two digit year code, a two digit month code, and a two digit day code. This\nis easily generated by a f-string in Python.\nOnce we got to a specific day’s page, there’s only one image on it. So, we\ncan just search the HTML for the only img tag and get the link to the image\nresource. He only wanted to recreate deep space pictures, i.e. no panoramic Earth night sky or\nhuman creations should be in the pictures. We thought the easiest way to narrow\ndown the images without manually inspecting them all was to restrict ourselves\nto images that had “NGC” in their page description. NGC stands for New General\nCatalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars. It was created in 1888 and has\nthousands of nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies in it.\nSo, we got to writing code.\nAltogether, this results in a nice, short script as shown below.\nBelow you can see an example of images scraped from APOD. They’re beautifully\ncrisp and colorful images of just the deep space objects we were after. Remember\nthis image for later so you can compare it to the results we achieved.\nAltogether, we settled on using 454 images.\nMachine learning time\nOnce we had our dataset of images, we were ready to do some machine learning. First,\nwe needed to preprocess and standardize the images for the GAN. Then,\nwe got to the actual training.\nPre-processing\nI thought it would be easiest if all the images were small and the same size.\nThus, we wrote the script below to first crop the images and then resize them\nto a standard size. Note all the training images have been placed in a directory\ncalled raw, and we write out the resized images to folders with names formatted\nbinned_{size}, e.g. binned_512 for images resized to 512x512 pixels.\nWe cropped first to avoid squashing the images in weird ways that would distort\nthe astronomical objects within them.\nTraining\nThere’s a plethora of GAN architectures to choose from, but we had some special\nconstraints: only 454 small images and limited compute power. We were originally\ngoing to use his PC, but ultimately ended up training it on Google Colab (more\non this later).\nThus, we tried using the “lighteight GAN” model by Liu eta al. 2021 because “the model converges from scratch with just\na few hours of training on a single RTX-2080 GPU, and has a consistent performance, even with less than 100 training samples.”\nThey have an official PyTorch implementation available here on GitHub,\nbut we decided to go with this implementation instead\nbecause it was easy to set up and get running. It’s a very professional implementation; thank you to its author Phil Wang.\nTo run the code we simply fired up a GPU instance of Google Colab,\nran pip install lightweight-gan, and then ran\nWhile the command is long, it was easy to construct and ran like a charm with\nbackground execution in Google Colab.\nWe waited for about 18 hours, and the run had finished! We could see intermediate\nresults all along the way and had model checkpoints every 100 iterations in case anything failed.\nResults\nNow for the exciting part! Let’s look at some results. They aren’t as stunningly\nperfect as I’d hoped, but they are impressive and show promise.\nWe’ll consider the fidelity of images, the diversity of the fakes, the ability to\ninterpolate the latent space, and the “average”, fake APOD.\nTraining process\nThe video below shows the progress training. It starts with crazy noise images\nand rapid evolution in the first epochs and results in the final model at the video’s end.\nFeel free to adjust the speed in YouTube to get a slower or faster animation.\nAbout a third of the way into the 10,000 trainings steps, we can already see images that are\nreminiscent of APOD pictures. I let it keep training though to see if we got improved\nimages, which I believe we did.\nFidelity\nTake a look for yourself below at one of the fake images generated.\nIt clearly resembles a nebula, but it exhibits extensive checkboard artifacts.\nYou can see the convolution grid. If you want to read more about these kinds\nof artifacts and what can be done about them check out this fantastic article by Odena et al. (2016)\nand another by Aitken et al. (2017).\nWe are content with the current result as first step, and are interested in\nresolving this issue potentially in a future iteration.\nDiversity\nDo the images capture the diversity of astronomical objects in the source data?\nYou can see below an array of fake examples.\nThey do seem to cover the main categories we expect. I don’t see anything that looks\nalien; most images seem realistic-ish.\nNebulas\nHere are three nebulas.\nWe see a variety of color and structure in them.\nStar fields\nThe results include images that are pure starfields. I haven’t done any official\nanalysis, but it appears to me that the stars are much more regularly distributed\nin space than one might expect in space.\nGalaxies\nI feel there’s a shortage of galaxies, especially highly structure spiral galaxies\nin our results. I’m not sure if that’s just a bias from the APOD sample, if it’s\na consequence of the GAN, or if I’m just crazy and there’s no shortage.\nWe also see interesting galaxy groups!\nClusters\nGlobular clusters can be found in the fake results too.\nThus, overall it seems to reconstruct all the categories, albeit with a potential bias.\nInterpolation\nOne very cool thing that this implementation of lightweight-gan does is create\ninterpolation examples. In the image below, there are 8 images on the top row that we can\nthink of as starting points and 8 images on the bottom row we can think of as ending points.\nThen, the code interpolates in the model’s latent space to construct representative images\nbetween the start and end. I find the 6th column most fascinating in this example. We interpolate\nfrom a brilliant nebula to what appears to be a small galaxy.\nIt does seem that there are harsh transitions between the start and end point when\nthey’re dramatically different. I’m not sure what this means about the model though.\nAverage\nWe can also explore the average fake image. We took a sample of 1000 images\nand merely averaged them together. You end up with the image below.\nThere’s some nebulosity in the average; I might have expected it to be nearly black.\nUsing Google Colab\nOriginally, we were going to train the model on the student’s computer. However,\nwe started running into errors and resolving those errors just resulted in more\nerrors. Ultimately, there was some error about insufficient GPU memory. It might\nbe resolvable, but we thought this might be a good chance to try out Google Colab.\nI purchased a Pro+ subscription since I knew we’d have a long-running training session.\nI believe background execution was necessary because when I tried training without it, the runtime timed out.\nIt’s possible I just did something wrong. Regardless, Colab Pro+ did the trick. We actually trained\ntwice, once on a 128x128 sized images and then for the results shown here on 512x512 images.\nBetween the two training sessions, I found I had to wait because I’d used up my\nGPU allotment. It’s frustrating that Colab doesn’t tell you how long you’ll have to\nwait. I just tried several times in the next 24 hours, and it eventually let me\nstart another GPU runtime. I’ve heard that these wait times increase the more\nyou use Colab. I hope not.\nI was very happy with how Google Colab integrates with Google Drive. I could\noutput the images and model checkpoints to a shared directory on Google Drive.\nWe could both see the results. I woke up in the middle of the night during training\nsome and was able to grab my phone from the night stand and look at intermediate results.\nI knew it was still training without even getting up. I also struggled to contain\nmy excitement at the results and get back to sleep then.\nI’ll keep trying it out because there are more things I would like\nto train for work projects. Maybe I’ll write a full post in a few months about\nmy overall impression of Colab’s paid tiers.\nFuture work\nThere are many avenues to explore:\nSimply train the model for longer\nRemove the checkerboarding for higher fidelity images\nTry other GAN architectures to compare performance\nAnalyze the distribution of image object types to answer the question: “Do we capture a representative sample of APOD?”\nYour suggestions!\nConclusion\nThis was an exciting small project that has promising results! I hope my student\nhad as much fun doing it as I did.

I was unfamiliar with this work, but\nit makes a lot of sense to me. I want to think more critically about how I approach creativity in my work,\nnot so I can get more done but to enjoy the creation process more completely.\nThe Classic Four Stages\nIt seems everyone agrees there are at least four stages to the creative process. These were proposed by Graham Wallas in his book The Art of Thought. Some people divide them up\na bit differently, adding more or reorganizing the process. I like this figure from Geeks for Geeks that shows the\nmost commonly accepted four stages because it emphasizes that they aren’t always in order and can be repeated when\ncreating. But, it’s easiest to conceptualize by moving in a linear fashion.\n1. Preparation\nCreative work almost always begins with the preparation stage and will\nlikely return to it multiple times before completion. In the preparation\nstage, we ponder the problem deeply and learn as much about it as we can.\nThis is when we’re scouring books or reading blog posts. It involves\npotentially decades of experience honing your craft. It’s an interactive phase of taking notes and thinking very hard about the\ncreative task at hand. This stage is often overlooked in retellings of\ngenius but it’s always there.\n2. Incubation\nI’ve noticed in my work that I often need to take a break after the\npreparation stage. It turns out that’s pretty common. We have to let\nthe ideas explored in the first step incubate and grow. This is a\nmore passive stage where we let our subconscious brains continue working\nwhile we do other things. Maybe as short as taking a walk or as long as stepping back from the creative task for a few weeks.\nRecognizing and embracing this stage avoids burnout and frustration.\nBreaks are essential to the creative process.\n3. Illumination\nAfter we’ve let an idea incubate, there could be a sudden “eureka moment”\nor a slow realization of the best approach. Either way, that’s illumination. It’s when we piece together the work into something that\nmakes sense or has a cohesive structure. We try out ideas that come to us.\n4. Verification\n“Eureka moments” can be wrong or misleading. It takes many incorrect solutions or ideas to get to the one that works.\nIn the verification stage, we evaluate the results of illumination given\nthe preparation we’ve done. We revise and modify the idea to see if it truly fits.\nRepeat\nOne go around of this creative process doesn’t always result in a great work. For example, writing a book will require repeating the process many times: for each chapter, for each page, for each sentence. We might spend more time in some stages than others depending on the creative task. We might skip some steps altogether sometimes.\nIncorporating the steps into my work\nDifferent people will excel at different stages of the work. I find I get energized by new ideas during illumination or preparation but it can be challenging to revise them during verification. In addition, I can forget that incubation is critical and push myself so hard I miss great solutions. Projects require people who have strengths in different parts of the process.\nQuestions on which to reflect\nWhat part of the process am I on right now in this creative task?\nWould more preparation or incubation help me in this work?\nAm I clinging too much to an idea and missing others?\nWho can I talk to about this work to get more perspective?\nAm I avoiding the task of verifying? It can be a challenge to revise your own work.\nAm I rushing the process?\nNext steps\nI’m going to read Wallas’s The Art of Thought (assuming it isn’t too technical) and see what more I can learn about the creative process. It might be nice to look for related texts that emphasize these ideas in the context of software development or scientific research since those are most relevant to me.","description":"","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/stages-of-creativity/","path":"/blog/stages-of-creativity/","title":"Harnessing the stages of creativity for better work"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/suvi-calendar-heatmap/":{"body":"Introduction\nThe Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) aboard NOAA’s GOES takes\npictures of the Sun in 6 ultraviolet passbands.

Some misunderstood Problem 3 and tried proving something completely different than intended.&nbsp;After 15 minutes, they traded papers (with anonymous codes instead of their names so there was no embarrassment) and reviewed each someone else’s papers as we went over them in class. They wrote some lovely, encouraging comments to each other. For example, one student had no idea of what to do on the second problem so they left it blank and their reviewer wrote, “Bet you can do it now! :D.” Others noted where the proof failed and wrote a comment that they too had that difficulty. It’s refreshing to see such kindness. Finally, they took the same survey about their proof writing again and there were dramatic changes in confidence.\nMany more students were confident in their abilities. I’m not sure who the one who reported 1 after the exercise is. I hope they come to office hours.\nThis is in no way a rigorous test, but students expressed they learned more from this exercise because it forced them to think about the material instead of just going through the proof together on the board. I imagine there is a psychological benefit of seeing how someone else is doing too and being kind to them in written comments. It was also suggested that I do a problem example in class without proving it before class so students could hear my raw thought process first hand. I’ll have to think about that. I like being prepared, but I’m sure I could find some way to do that.","description":"","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/teaching-peer-review/","path":"/blog/teaching-peer-review/","title":"The Value of a Peer-Reviewed Activity"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/towncrier/":{"body":"towncrier (docs) is a utility to produce changelogs from projects.\nInstead of maintaining a changelog as a file that gets merge conflicts when different feature branches merge, you create\nnews fragments for each PR. These accumulate into the changelog at release.\nTo set it up, do the following things.\nAdd the following snippet to your pyproject.toml file:\nBe sure to replace punchbowl with your package name and user in the package and issue_format entries.\nThen, enable giles as a bot if you want PR checks by going here.\nThis will check each PR for a changelog update. If a PR doesn’t need a changelog, then you can add the no-changelog-entry-needed label.\nNow anytime you make a PR and have change, create a file in the changelog folder that ends in one of the following:\nbreaking\ndeprecation\nremoval\nfeature\nbugfix\ndoc\ntrivial\nSo for example, you might make a file 38.bugfix if PR 38 is a bugfix.\nIn the file, you write a description of what that change is, e.g. “Fixed the bug where the refresh button didn’t display.”\nThen, when you want to release simply run towncrier to populate the CHANGELOG.rst.\nI’m starting to use this with PUNCH software to make development and maintenance easier.","description":"Gone are the days of persistent merge conflicts with each changelog update.

You have a number, e.g. 1.25, and want to truncate it to say 2 significant figures. You specifically need to truncate instead of rounding, i.e. you need to get 1.2 instead of 1.3.

The vertical grey line shows the actual percentage of the features having a given class versus the horizontal axis what percentage of the class is identified by the model. For example, if the true class percentage is 0.1 as shown below we see that an aggressive classifier, one that prefers creating false positives, is punished much less by accuracy and TSS than by the f1-measure. If the model to classified 20% of the examples as a true example, the accuracy and TSS is around 0.9 while the f1-measure drops to around 0.65. Selecting your metric is very important depending on if you prefer false positives or false negatives.","description":"","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/tss-vs-f1/","path":"/blog/tss-vs-f1/","title":"TSS measure versus f1 measure"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/ulam-warburton/":{"body":"The Ulam-Warburton automaton is a simple growing pattern. See Wikipedia or this great Numberphile video for more information. For the more technical see this paper&nbsp;too.\nUlam-Warburton animation from Wikipedia\nI was curious what you’d get under various other versions of it, using the same basic rule of “turn on cells with exactly one neighbor” but with a tweak. For example, what happens if you a cell turns off after being activated for a few cycles?\nYou get this beautiful modification. I plan to follow this up more and will make code available then (although it’s insanely simple). I would be curious what statements you can make about the periodicity and the number of active cells at any time.\nFor example, empirically it seems that the number of cells in a “dying” version is always upper bounded by the ageless and standard Ulam-Warburton Automaton. Now, prove that and derive formulas (or prove it’s not possible) for a generalized version.\nOther ideas:\nHow does the total cell count formula change depending on the starting configuration, e.g. more than one active cell?\nAre there interesting stochastic versions?\nWhat happens when cells have a regeneration period, a time after they die before they can activate again? That models disease and other phenomena better maybe since resources/population has to restore before a new outbreak is successful.\nWhat if the age of a cell is a function of its position on the plane?\nCan we generalize to other grid types?\nHow does this fit into other work? Has it already been done?\nThis whole curiosity partially started because I wanted to assign a simple proof about Ulam-Warburton to my summer discrete math class.
