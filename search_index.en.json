Here are notes of what I set up.\nI added codespell to the pre-commit hook and to the GitHub Action for continuous integration. I did both because I wanted to make sure\nwe caught spelling errors even if a contributor wasn't complying with the pre-commit. When the repo is public and we can add the\npre-commit action via GitHub, I may remove the CI step because it would be extra redundant. Although, it's pretty fast so it doesn't really matter.\n\nAdding to pre-commit\nTo add to the pre-commit I just added a section to my .pre=commit-config.yaml file:\n\nThis addition forces it to run on all Python, C, Header, Markdown, Restructured Test, and YAML files.

These are the slides and handwritten notes. I plan to explore this idea further and write up better LaTeX notes, which I will then share as well. For now, the idea of atypicality centers around using two coders: one trained to perform best on typical data and one that is universal and not data specific. A sequence is atypical if its code length using the typical coder is longer than the universal coder, i.e. it is not favored by the typical coder indicating the information is somehow unique.\n\nAn example of the usage of atypicality from their 2019 paper \"Data Discovery and Anomaly Detection using Atypicality for Real-valued data.\"\nI presented on Elyas Sabeti and Anders H⊘st-Madsen's 2016 paper titled \"How interesting images are: An atypicality approach for social networks\". I think there are lots of opportunities for development in the image space, e.g. using different representations of images maybe including deep learning, exploring what made those images interesting by training a supervised classifier on the resulting labels and exploring the learned features. I'm concerned that their atypicality could be keying on background features, a lot more investigation is needed to understand the details of this application. I also think the image application needs more rigorous validation. They could have tested against other kinds of images to see if they also were labeled as atypical.

In order to identify interesting new events to study, a solar physicist\nmust monitor data streams observing the Sun on a regular basis. I thought it might be neat to make a\ntool that would automatically download extreme ultraviolet images of the Sun from the GOES-R SUVI instrument\nand then upload them as a movie to YouTube for easy monitoring. My goal was to use Prefect\nto run the entire process on a schedule. However, it appears YouTube has special restrictions on who can upload\nusing scripts. For now, I can have the video creation\nautomated but have to manually upload the video each day.\n\nCore Code\nBelow is the core of the code that makes this happen.\n\n\nWalkthrough\nIt's easiest to read this code from bottom to top. You'll see that the script when executed starts by calling make_suvi_channel_movie.\nThis Prefect flow handles the main logic. (If you've never used Prefect I'd recommend checking out their docs. I find them quite helpful.])\nFirst, we use a Python package I made a while back called goes-solar-retriever\nto download the SUVI images for a given day. We download them all to one temporary directory. We'll open them one-by-one in the\nrender_suvi_channel_movie function to avoid overloading our memory with too many images. We can make one frame at a time.\n(You may still have trouble with this approach if you tried a long period of data because of how I used ImageClip from MoviePy.\nI'm not sure how much memory each clip consumes. Another approach is to write a .png file for each frame and then use a tool like ffmpeg\nto generate a movie.)\nIn the internal make_frame function, we do some fancy scaling of the images so that they look better. We also set each frame to show for\n0.25 seconds. With 360 images per day from SUVI's Level 2 products, we can make a 1.5 minute video. YouTube converts any videos shorter than\na minute to the shorts format. That would be undesirable for us because it means you cannot scrobble through the video; you're stuck watching it from\nbeginning to end.\n\nAutomating the YouTube upload\nAs I mentioned in the intro, due to restrictions from YouTube you cannot upload from a script and make the video public automatically it seems.\nEverytime I tried my video got locked for review. I believe they're worried that spammers/scammers could upload many videos using scripts. It seems\nthere is a way around this, but it takes a special review that I didn't apply for.\nHowever, if you had permissions to upload public videos there is a nice Python package called simple-youtube-api that simplifies interfacing with YouTube.\nIf you read its GitHub or just Googling around you can find instructions on setting up the needed credentials.\n\nBy injecting that task at the end of your flow, you could upload the videos automatically.\n\nExtending with thematic maps\nWe can extend the code above to generate thematic map movies from SUVI as well. The thematic map product identifies what different phenomena are present on the Sun,\ne.g. bright regions, coronal holes, filaments. You can read more about my thematic map work in this press release\nor in this paper. The image below shows a three-color composite of SUVI images\non the left and a thematic map on the right. Yellow, for example, are bright regions while green are coronal holes.\n\nThe code gets a bit more complicated because the thematic maps neede to be rendered with a specific color table.\nI added a utility build_thmap_cmap to help with this process.\n\nCode for thematic maps\n\n\nResults and future improvements\nYou can see the first such movie I created at this YouTube video. The colormap could be\nchanged to match the standard SUVI colormaps. It also doesn't have high enough contrast in my opinion. But it's a first step.\nI would like to continue this line of automated visualization and include other detection algorithms. For example, it would be cool\nto be able to identify all the bright points on the Sun over the course of a day, analyze their properties, and output a result chart.\n","description":"","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/automatic-suvi-youtube/","path":"/blog/automatic-suvi-youtube/","title":"Automating SUVI YouTube"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/axis-aligned-artifacts/":{"body":"There are artifacts created by choosing axis aligned cuts in robust random cut forests, similar to what was noted with IsoForest..\n\nLeft: Original data distribution.

You can access it via the website or by building it yourself from source. You can find the source code for the library and for the graphical user interface(GUI) on GitHub. The GUI is currently implemented using Rust's egui. Let's back up a bit though.\n\nWhat is an iterated function system?\nAn iterated function system or IFS is a formal mathematical structure. More technically, it's a set of contractive mappings. They can be used to generate fractals. Fractals are never ending, repeating, mathematical patterns. They occur in nature a lot actually. Trees, lightning, and galaxies all exhibit some fractal patterns. We won't go into great detail of the math in this article, maybe a future aricle will.\nI think of an IFS as a set of \"transforms\" that each have weights and properties. When evaluating an IFS, we will generate a bunch of random points. A transform is just an instruction that tells you how to convert one point to the next one. For example, a transform might say that if you're at the center of an image you should then jump to the right. I've implemented four transforms so far in Barnsley: Linear, Affine, Inverse Julia, and Moebius. They each have a different mathematically form and thus different parameters to adjust.\n\n\nMathematical descriptions of the transforms\nFeel free to skip this section if you want to avoid math.\n\nLinear\nThe Linear transform has four real parameters: $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. It takes a point $(x, y)$ and mutates it to  $$(ax + by, cx + dy)$$\n\nAffine\nThe Affine transform has six real parameters: $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $\\mathrm{xshift}$, and $\\mathrm{yshift}$. It takes a point $(x,y)$ and mutates it to $$(ax + by + \\mathrm{xshift}, cx + dy + \\mathrm{yshift})$$\n\nMoebius\nThe Moebius transform has four complex parameters: $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. It takes a point $(x, y)$ and defines a complex $z_1 = a + bi$ . We then calculate $$z_2 = \\frac{a * z_1 + b}{c * z_1 + d}$$. It ultimately mutates the point to $$(\\Re(z_2), \\Im(z_2))$$ where $\\Re(z_2)$ is the real part of $z_2$ and $\\Im(z_2)$ is the imaginary part of $z_2$.\n\nInverse Julia\nThe Inverse Julia transform has two real parameters: $r$ and $\\theta$. It's the most complicated transform computationally. It takes a point $(x, y)$ and mutates it by first defining $c = r \\cos{\\theta} + (r \\sin{\\theta})i$. We let $z = x + yi$. Then, $z_2 = c - z$. $\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{atan2}(\\Im(z_2), \\Re(z_2))}{2}$ where $\\Re(z_2)$ is the real part of $z_2$ and $\\Im(z_2)$ is the imaginary part of $z_2$. Further,\n$$\n\\mathrm{atan2} (y,x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\arctan \\left({\\frac {y}{x}}\\right )&amp; \\text{if } x&gt;0 \\ \\newline\n\\frac {\\pi }{2} -\\arctan{\\frac {x}{y}} &amp; \\text{if }y&gt;0 \\ \\newline\n-\\frac {\\pi }{2}-\\arctan{\\frac {x}{y}} &amp; \\text{if }y&lt;0 \\ \\newline\n\\arctan{\\frac {y}{x}} \\pm \\pi &amp; {\\text{if }}x&lt;0 \\ \\newline\n\\text{undefined} &amp; \\text{if }x=0\\text{ and }y=0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe let $k = -1$ with $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability and $k = 1$ with $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability so that\n$\ns = k \\sqrt{\\Im(z_2) * \\Im(z_2) + \\Re(z_2) * \\Re(z_2)}\n$\nFinally, $(x, y)$ becomes $$(s  \\cos{\\theta_2}, s \\sin{\\theta_2})$$\nIt's not a simple one, but it's powerful.\n\nAdditional parameters\nIn addition to the mathematical parameters, each transform has a weight and a color. The weight is used when randomly picking the next transform. Higher weight means it's more likely to be chosen. The color is blended into the point in each iteration.\n\nHow to use the tool\nThe website is hopefully straight forward to use. It has the same layout as if you installed the tool on your machine. Note that the website doesn't currently support mobile devices though. For using the tool on a computer, either through the website or installation, see the tricks below.\n\n\nCreate section\nIn the \"Create\" section of the tool, there are a few buttons: randomize, open parameters, save image, and save parameters. Randomize is a fun way to adjust all the parameters in the IFS's transforms at once. It doesn't add or remove transforms though, so if you want to dramatically change the quality of the IFS I'd recommend adding or deleting transforms first. Then, randomize to your heart's content to get different examples.\nOnce you have found a good IFS, you can save the image as a PNG file and/or save the parameters to a JSON file. I've been annoyed that the file prompt doesn't seem to suggest the file extension in the web browser. Thus, when you save an image you have to put a \".png\" on the end of the filename. When you save parameters, you should similarly put \".json\" as the extension.\nIf you want to return to an IFS later, you must save the parameters. When you refresh, it'll be reset. If you've saved the parameters, you can use the open parameters button to select the JSON file you created and revisualize the transform though.\n\nAdjusting generation properties\nUnder the \"Generation controls\" section of the tool, you will see the capability to adjust the image height, image width, the number of points generated in each image, and the number of iterations for each point. Note that changing the number of points or number of iterations could slow down the generation. I find it's nice to start with them set low until I find an interesting transform and then crank them up to make the image quality more impressive.\n\nMutating parameters\nBy mutating the parameters, you can step smoothly between iterated function systems. We can start with a system that looks like the left and mutate parameters slowly to get to the right.\n\nTo do this, you just open one of the Transforms and more the slider slowly while saving in between steps.\nSuch a smooth transition indicates we might be able to make cool animations. See below for some examples and the plans to add the capability to the tool.\n\nAdding transforms\nAt the moment, there are only four transform types implemented as described earlier in this article. You can add any of them. If you want to delete one later, you can open that transform in the transforms section and click the delete button.\n\nTwo cool results\nThere are lots of cool images you can create. One of my favorites is:\n\nI've started using that one as a profile picture in a few places.\nYou can also generate known fractals, like the Sierpinski Triangle:\n\n\nAnimations\nOne thing that isn't in the tool yet is generating animations. I've started playing around with it though. See some examples:\n\nFuture plans\nI hope to continue developing the application. I may convert away from the egui frontend because it's a bit tedious and not as aesthetically appealing as I'd like. I also want to implement the animation interface so you can visualize animations in the tool easily and save movies. There's a fair bit of tech debt in the codebase too. I've hackishly done many things and realized better ways to do them later. This was a Rust learning project afterall. So, I'll likely try rewriting the codebase and releasing a more stable version that is cleaner.

Depending on the subfield\nof astronomy one might use a variety of coordinate systems, but one of the most common is equatorial.\nThese are both spherical geometries.\nHowever, it turns out to be a bit complicated to convert directly between the two. Astropy and SunPy\noffer utilities to do the conversion, but I was running into some challenges. I asked Sam Van Kooten for\nhelp, and we came up with this solution. It only applies when the observer is the center of the Earth though.\n\nConverting a single coordinate\nFirst, we need to know how to convert a single coordinate.\nAstropy has a system of transormations that form a computational graph. SunPy augments this with the\ncommon solar coordinate systems. If we try to convert helioprojective to GCRS, we'll be doing several\nsteps of conversions: Helioprojective to Heliocentric to HeliographicStonyhurst to HCRS to ICRS and finally to GCRS.\nThis shouldn't really be required. So, we'll register a new transformation that goes from helioprojective straight to GCRS.\n\nThe meat of the transformation happens when setting up the matrices in the last function.\nThey're rotation matrices to go from one to the other using the Sun's right ascension and declination coupled with the solar P angle.\nWe carefully use the P angle in GCRS instead of SunPy's built-in sun.P, which I believe uses ITRS.\nWe can then use Astropy's infrastructure for conversions.\n\nIt's quite nifty.\n\nTransforming a WCS from helio to celestial\nSo let's say you have a world coordinate system in helioprojective. How can you use this to convert to GCRS?\nFirst, you transform the CRVAL using the coordinate transform we just defined.\nThen, you transform the PC matrix by rotating by the P angle.\n\nSince this code was developed for PUNCH, we have a polarization axis that makes this WCS 3D in some cases.\nSo, we handle that here too.\n\nTransforming the opposite direction\nYou can reverse this too!\n\n\nVerifying\nWe have many tests to verify this works properly.\nWe use the Sun's position to go back and forth with known coordinates.\nWe also test that given an arbitrary WCS you can convert to the other system and then convert back and\nget the original input. All our tests pass.\n\nConclusions\nThis code was developed for PUNCH to go back and forth between helioprojective and GCRS.\nIt was used to create some synthetic images that are like what PUNCH will see.\nThose files include both a helioprojective and equatorial WCS so you can locate things in context of\nthe Sun and the stars.\nHere's a sneak peak of what these images look like.\n\nI'll write more about the synthetic images in the future.\n","description":"Change between world coordinate systems using Astropy and SunPy","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/converting-coordinates/","path":"/blog/converting-coordinates/","title":"Converting helioprojective to equatorial"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/crash-course-in-rust/":{"body":"These slides are from a while back, but I didn't want to lose them.\n\n    \n ","description":"Slides I gave about getting started in Rust.","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/crash-course-in-rust/","path":"/blog/crash-course-in-rust/","title":"Crash Course in Rust"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/dash2024/":{"body":"Below are my DASH 2024 slides:\n\n    \n \nAlso available through Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/13925458\n","description":"Slides for the 2024 meeting of Data, Analysis, and Software in Heliophysics conference","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/dash2024/","path":"/blog/dash2024/","title":"DASH 2024"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/denoising-autoencoder/":{"body":"\nHow do you denoise images with an autoencoder if you don't have a clean version to train with? One option is to add more noise to your images! In this experiment, I trained an autoencoder with noisy MNIST data. I began with MNIST images on the bottom row, the noiseless versions. To simulate observational data, I added Gaussian noise to the images. In reality, we may never have access to these noiseless images. To train an autoencoder we need an input set with noise and output set without noise so the autoencoder can learn the denoising procedure. An autoencoder could potentially also learn the denoising procedure if we gave it extra noisy images as input and slightly denoised images as output. To simulate this, I added more Gaussian noise to the observations to arrive at the top row. Then, the top row is input and the second row is the output for training. When we want to denoise observations, we use this trained network with the observations as input and the denoised row as our output.\nI am not sure how sensitive this is to an accurate noise model when adding noise or the amount of noise added. In the solar extreme ultraviolet setting, we suffer more from shot/Poisson noise than Gaussian noise.

So there will sometimes be major outliers stemming from bad pixels in images.\nMy quick solution is just to throw out outliers less than three standard deviations by filtering the input $x$ and $y$.\nThis results in a fit like the following:\n\nWe're using this to build better F-corona models for PUNCH.\nMore to come on that!\nAll together, the script is:\n\n","description":"Use quadratic programming to fit a cubic polynomial below a curve","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/fit-cubic/","path":"/blog/fit-cubic/","title":"Best underestimate cubic fitting"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/flood-puzzle/":{"body":"I stumbled upon a game called Flood.

One of my students is taking\nAP Computer Science at the same time. His teacher requires all the students to\ncomplete a final project of their choosing; they have complete freedom in\npicking the project except it has to be approved by the teacher. (That sounds\nlike an awesome teacher by the way, encouraging students to learn on their own\nby pursuing their own passion projects. That's how you really learn.)\nI've been teaching machine learning to this particular student, so we started\nbrainstorming ML projects. Ultimately, he wanted to use a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) to generate fake space pictures. We were inspired by\nseveral\nother\nprojects conducted by professional\nastronomers and computer scientists and reported in the academic literature.\nI was excited by this project because it unites two of my passions: machine learning\nand astronomy.\nWe decided the project would use images from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).\nThey are, after all, some of the best images of our universe!\nWe outlined the project in a few steps:\n\nTeach him about how GANs work\nImplement a basic GAN on a common dataset like MNIST\nScrape APOD for all pictures that meet our criteria\nTrain a sophisticated GAN to fake APOD!\n\nI won't go into too much detail about steps 1 and 2 here and focus most on\nsteps 3 and 4.\n\nScraping APOD\nIt turns out getting images from APOD is easier than I expected. Our initial\napproach was to parse the archive\nas a jumping off point. However, we quickly noticed that all the links had a\nstandard form. To get the image from May 25th, 2022 you simply go to\nhttps://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220525.html. The URL is just ap followed by\na two digit year code, a two digit month code, and a two digit day code. This\nis easily generated by a f-string in Python.\nOnce we got to a specific day's page, there's only one image on it. So, we\ncan just search the HTML for the only img tag and get the link to the image\nresource. He only wanted to recreate deep space pictures, i.e. no panoramic Earth night sky or\nhuman creations should be in the pictures. We thought the easiest way to narrow\ndown the images without manually inspecting them all was to restrict ourselves\nto images that had \"NGC\" in their page description. NGC stands for New General\nCatalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars. It was created in 1888 and has\nthousands of nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies in it.\nSo, we got to writing code.\nAltogether, this results in a nice, short script as shown below.\n\nBelow you can see an example of images scraped from APOD. They're beautifully\ncrisp and colorful images of just the deep space objects we were after. Remember\nthis image for later so you can compare it to the results we achieved.\n\nAltogether, we settled on using 454 images.\n\nMachine learning time\nOnce we had our dataset of images, we were ready to do some machine learning. First,\nwe needed to preprocess and standardize the images for the GAN. Then,\nwe got to the actual training.\n\nPre-processing\nI thought it would be easiest if all the images were small and the same size.\nThus, we wrote the script below to first crop the images and then resize them\nto a standard size. Note all the training images have been placed in a directory\ncalled raw, and we write out the resized images to folders with names formatted\nbinned_{size}, e.g. binned_512 for images resized to 512x512 pixels.\n\nWe cropped first to avoid squashing the images in weird ways that would distort\nthe astronomical objects within them.\n\nTraining\nThere's a plethora of GAN architectures to choose from, but we had some special\nconstraints: only 454 small images and limited compute power. We were originally\ngoing to use his PC, but ultimately ended up training it on Google Colab (more\non this later).\nThus, we tried using the \"lighteight GAN\" model by Liu eta al. 2021 because \"the model converges from scratch with just\na few hours of training on a single RTX-2080 GPU, and has a consistent performance, even with less than 100 training samples.\"\nThey have an official PyTorch implementation available here on GitHub,\nbut we decided to go with this implementation instead\nbecause it was easy to set up and get running. It's a very professional implementation; thank you to its author Phil Wang.\nTo run the code we simply fired up a GPU instance of Google Colab,\nran pip install lightweight-gan, and then ran\n\nWhile the command is long, it was easy to construct and ran like a charm with\nbackground execution in Google Colab.\nWe waited for about 18 hours, and the run had finished! We could see intermediate\nresults all along the way and had model checkpoints every 100 iterations in case anything failed.\n\nResults\nNow for the exciting part! Let's look at some results. They aren't as stunningly\nperfect as I'd hoped, but they are impressive and show promise.\nWe'll consider the fidelity of images, the diversity of the fakes, the ability to\ninterpolate the latent space, and the \"average\", fake APOD.\n\nTraining process\nThe video below shows the progress training. It starts with crazy noise images\nand rapid evolution in the first epochs and results in the final model at the video's end.\nFeel free to adjust the speed in YouTube to get a slower or faster animation.\n\nAbout a third of the way into the 10,000 trainings steps, we can already see images that are\nreminiscent of APOD pictures. I let it keep training though to see if we got improved\nimages, which I believe we did.\n\nFidelity\nTake a look for yourself below at one of the fake images generated.\n\nIt clearly resembles a nebula, but it exhibits extensive checkboard artifacts.\nYou can see the convolution grid. If you want to read more about these kinds\nof artifacts and what can be done about them check out this fantastic article by Odena et al. (2016)\nand another by Aitken et al. (2017).\nWe are content with the current result as first step, and are interested in\nresolving this issue potentially in a future iteration.\n\nDiversity\nDo the images capture the diversity of astronomical objects in the source data?\nYou can see below an array of fake examples.\n\nThey do seem to cover the main categories we expect. I don't see anything that looks\nalien; most images seem realistic-ish.\n\nNebulas\nHere are three nebulas.\n\n\n\nWe see a variety of color and structure in them.\n\nStar fields\nThe results include images that are pure starfields. I haven't done any official\nanalysis, but it appears to me that the stars are much more regularly distributed\nin space than one might expect in space.\n\n\nGalaxies\nI feel there's a shortage of galaxies, especially highly structure spiral galaxies\nin our results. I'm not sure if that's just a bias from the APOD sample, if it's\na consequence of the GAN, or if I'm just crazy and there's no shortage.\n\nWe also see interesting galaxy groups!\n\n\nClusters\nGlobular clusters can be found in the fake results too.\n\nThus, overall it seems to reconstruct all the categories, albeit with a potential bias.\n\nInterpolation\nOne very cool thing that this implementation of lightweight-gan does is create\ninterpolation examples. In the image below, there are 8 images on the top row that we can\nthink of as starting points and 8 images on the bottom row we can think of as ending points.\nThen, the code interpolates in the model's latent space to construct representative images\nbetween the start and end. I find the 6th column most fascinating in this example. We interpolate\nfrom a brilliant nebula to what appears to be a small galaxy.\n\nIt does seem that there are harsh transitions between the start and end point when\nthey're dramatically different. I'm not sure what this means about the model though.\n\nAverage\nWe can also explore the average fake image. We took a sample of 1000 images\nand merely averaged them together. You end up with the image below.\n\nThere's some nebulosity in the average; I might have expected it to be nearly black.\n\nUsing Google Colab\nOriginally, we were going to train the model on the student's computer. However,\nwe started running into errors and resolving those errors just resulted in more\nerrors. Ultimately, there was some error about insufficient GPU memory. It might\nbe resolvable, but we thought this might be a good chance to try out Google Colab.\nI purchased a Pro+ subscription since I knew we'd have a long-running training session.\nI believe background execution was necessary because when I tried training without it, the runtime timed out.\nIt's possible I just did something wrong. Regardless, Colab Pro+ did the trick. We actually trained\ntwice, once on a 128x128 sized images and then for the results shown here on 512x512 images.\nBetween the two training sessions, I found I had to wait because I'd used up my\nGPU allotment. It's frustrating that Colab doesn't tell you how long you'll have to\nwait. I just tried several times in the next 24 hours, and it eventually let me\nstart another GPU runtime. I've heard that these wait times increase the more\nyou use Colab. I hope not.\nI was very happy with how Google Colab integrates with Google Drive. I could\noutput the images and model checkpoints to a shared directory on Google Drive.\nWe could both see the results. I woke up in the middle of the night during training\nsome and was able to grab my phone from the night stand and look at intermediate results.\nI knew it was still training without even getting up. I also struggled to contain\nmy excitement at the results and get back to sleep then.\nI'll keep trying it out because there are more things I would like\nto train for work projects. Maybe I'll write a full post in a few months about\nmy overall impression of Colab's paid tiers.\n\nFuture work\nThere are many avenues to explore:\n\nSimply train the model for longer\nRemove the checkerboarding for higher fidelity images\nTry other GAN architectures to compare performance\nAnalyze the distribution of image object types to answer the question: \"Do we capture a representative sample of APOD?\"\nYour suggestions!\n\n\nConclusion\nThis was an exciting small project that has promising results! I hope my student\nhad as much fun doing it as I did. We're open to suggestions from you, the reader, about what else we could do.\n","description":"","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/galaxy-gan/","path":"/blog/galaxy-gan/","title":"Creating fake APOD pictures"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/hek-thmap/":{"body":"The below script will allow you to generate thematic maps from the valuable Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase&nbsp;(HEK).

There's something beautiful about that though.\nWe have the opportunity to declare what is important to us by spending our time on it. Burkeman writes the following:\n\nYou can take action not in the tense hope that your actions might be leading you towards some future utopia of perfect productivity,\nbut simply because they're worth doing.... It's precisely because you'll never produce perfect\nwork that you might as well get on with doing the best work you can.\n\nIt's important for me to remember that doesn't mean work all the time though because work isn't the total meaning of my life.\nI am finite and imperfect. That's wonderful.\n\nDay 2\nIt's easy to fall into the trap of preparing to do something or developing systems to do something. However, neither preparing or developing will actually complete the task. If you want to write, then sit down and write for 15 minutes instead of spending the time getting nice paper and pens or reading a book about effective writing skills. If you want to meditate, then sit down and meditate for 15 minutes instead of buying a cushion or watching lectures on how to meditate. Action is paramount.\nThis is a good lesson from Burkeman. Systems are not the way we accomplish our goals. Doing is.\nI've recently thrown myself into action, the action of simplifying my physical possessions until they fit into my car. There are many reasons for this: from wanting to move apartments to possibly being in some kind of quarter life crisis (I prefer to think of it as a quarter life revolution). I could have spent months reading about minimalism or agonized about creating a priority system for what I should keep and what I should get rid of. Instead, it was much more effective for me to start selling things on Craigslist. I started with things I hadn't used in a while, the easy things to get rid of, but I've advanced now to things I thought were essential, for example a bed. (Some other time I'll write about the joys of furniture free living.) I don't know if it's the simplification or just the act of doing something to align with my values, but it's exhilarating. I'm enjoying this journey.\nTake action.\n\nDay 3\nI'm a day behind. Oops.\n\nConsequences aren't optional. It's in the nature of being finite that every choice comes with some sort of consequences, because at any instant, you can only pick one path and must deal with the repercussions of not picking any of the others.\n\n\nWhatever choice you make, so long as you make it in the spirit of facing the consequences, the result will be freedom in the only sense that finite humans ever get to enjoy it. Not freedom from limitation, which is something we unfortunately never get to experience, but freedom in limitation. Freedom to examine the trade-offs -- because there will always be trade-offs -- and then to opt for whichever trade-off you like.\n\nI find this a particularly hard lesson to stomach and take joy in. I can tell myself that I accept there are consequences but I often later realize I haven't really accepted it at all. I deceive myself into thinking I can be infinite or can somehow optimize my way to the best path. I don't think a best path really exists though because the set of consequences are many dimensional and not comparable.\nThere is comfort in realizing that you aren't forced into any path (most of the time). You can choose to ignore an email or work on a different project. There will be consequences but we get to choose which consequence to have.\n\nDay 4\nToday's entry was about how we often measure ourselves by our accomplishments.\nIn particular, Burkeman proposed keeping a \"done\" list in addition to a \"to do\" list. I use Tick Tick to manage my tasks most of the time. It will automatically created a completed entry when I check off a task.\nHowever, I see that as visual clutter and ignore it. I forget about the tasks I complete the second I complete them.\nMore than just writing a done list, I would benefit potentially from taking time each day to reflect on my\naccomplishments, to celebrate them. It's easy to get wrapped up in the length of the \"to do\" list and never\nacknowledge the length of the \"done\" list. I'm going to test out writing three accomplishments I most proud of each day when I journal in the evening.\n\nDay 5\nThere's too much information to read or consume it all. We have to make tradeoffs. Burkeman suggests three principles:\n\n\"Treat your to-read pile like a river, not a bucket.\" You don't have to empty the container, just pick something that seems appealing as it floats past.\n\"Resist the urge to stockpile knowledge.\" You don't have to take extensive notes or remember everything you've read. You'll still get impacted by it.\n\"Consuming information is a present-moment activity.\" Enjoy it for now, not for some future benefit.\n\nI wonder if these posts are my stockpiling knowledge instinct.\n\nDay 6\n\nIn an age of attention scarcity, the greatest act of good citizenship may be learning to withdraw your attention from everything except the battles you've chosen to fight.\n\nYou don't have to solve every world problem. Pick something you're passionate about and spend your energy on it instead of spreading it out over many causes.\n\nDay 7\n\nThe fact that you can't cross bridges before you come to them is liable to seem dispiriting, as if it leaves us with no option but to keep trudging vulnerably into the fog, trying not to think about sinkholes. But it contains a hidden gift. After all, if you're hopelessly trapped in the present, it follows that your responsibility can only ever be to the very next moment... You get to stop fretting about literally everything other than how to spend the next instant in a wise, enjoyable or otherwise meaningful fashion. Finite human being need never worry about anything else.\n\nIs it really true that my \"responsibility can only ever be to the very next moment?\" Why is the horizon set so short? What about just the next two moments? I don't think I fully grasp the meaning of this entry. It's comfortable to imagine we don't have to worry about the future, but don't we need to worry about tomorrow? If we didn't, who would stop climate change?\nMaybe the point is we can only act in the moment and thus by making the greedy and locally good choice, then we'll be better off in the long run? But why should life be solved by a greedy algorithm?\nI don't like the phrase \"life can be solved.\" It misses a key element that life has no solution.\nI'm not sure about this.\n\nDay 8\n\n\"The whole point of facing the truth about finitude is that it gets easier to spend more of your time on worthwhile and life-enriching activities once you're no longer trying to do all of them, or do them perfectly, or do them with the secret agenda of achieving a feeling of security or control.\"\n\nThat first quotation has much to unpack. There are many ways we can be paralyzed about our finitude. I feel like some of them, such as \"trying to do them all\" or \"do them perfectly,\" are more noticeable and diagnosable. The \"secret agenda\" though could be secret even from yourself. It's easy to live life without complete awareness. How might I diagnose this agenda? If I make decisions with comfort in mind, it might be an indication. This is worth thinking about more.\n\n\"The life enhancing route is to think of decisions not as things that come along, but as things to go hunting for.\"\n\nMaking decisions only about things that fall into your lap is not as fulfilling because it doesn't allow you to define the life you want. Instead, seek out decisions about things that matter to you. Decisions are about defining your life and owning it how you want.\n\n\"To make a decision -- any decision -- is to take ownership of the situation instead.\"\n\nAccording to Burkeman, there are two rules to decision making:\n\n\n\"A decision doesn't get to count as a decision until you've done something about it in reality, so as to put some of the discarded alternatives beyond reach.\" You cannot just decide it in your mind. That's not a real decision because there's no consequence. Decisions become real with action.\n\n\nA decision can be as tiny as you like. \"Baby steps are fine; they just have to be real ones.\" You don't have to radically transform everything with a decision. You can take tiny steps. He compares this to a scenario to quit your job. You don't have to march into your boss's office, announce all your complaints, and quit to have made a decision. You can instead decide to have a trusted friend over and discuss your feelings.\n\n\nDecisions come with an uncertainty. Making one decisions necessarily precludes you from making a different decision. We cannot know which is the best decision in the moment.\n\n\"In fact, you'll never know in hindsight [what the best choice might be], either -- because no matter how great or appalling the consequences of heading down any given path, you'll never learn whether heading down a different one might have brought something better or worse.\"\n\nThere is no best decision because you don't know how all the others might have turned out. Don't let the exclusivity enforced by deciding prevent you from acting. Relish in the power of making worthwhile and life-enriching decisions.\n\nDay 9\n\n\"Perfectionists love to begin new endeavors, because the moment of starting belongs to the world of limitlessness: for as long as you haven't done any work on a project, it's still possible to believe that the end result might match the ideal in your mind.\"\n\nI've never really thought about it like that. There's something exciting and wonderful about the blue sky and green field of a new project. It really is limitless, bursting with possibility. I enjoy starting the project and even doing some work. However, when it gets to that last 20 percent, the final details that take the longest, I start to lose joy in the project and have to rely on discipline to complete it. I don't think all of that stems from perfectionism but rather novelty wearing off and the decreasing speed of progress. Like the Pareto principle, the first 80 percent makes the biggest impact and sometimes goes the fastest. The novelty wears off and progress becomes very incremental in the last phases of a project. That isn't to say that there isn't some amount of perfectionism at work though.\n\n\"The trick to finishing things when the prospect seems overwhelming is simply to redefine what counts as finished. Instead of viewing completion of a project as something that happens only occasionally, after days or weeks of work, think of your days as consisting in the sequential completion of a series of small 'deliverables.'\n\nThis suggests a new way to complete the last 20 percent of a project: make each step smaller and smaller to offset the decrease in novelty and trudge of small details. By having smaller and smaller steps, you encounter and benefit from the boost associated with completing a task.\n\n\"For finite humans, every moment is an endpoint of sorts, experienced once then done forever. Treating what you do with your time as a sequence of tiny completions means falling into line with how things really are.\"\n\nJust a lovely sentiment.\n\nDay 10\nThis chapter is all about 'What is your current life task?'. Burkeman writes, \"a life task is something your life is asking of you; so while it might coincide with your parents' expectations, or your society's ideals, it also very easily might not.\" I don't feel very confident in my understanding of life tasks so I can neither definitively disagree with the concept nor embrace it.\nIt seems like a misappropriation of a sense of purpose or meaning in a task. How can my life ask anything of me? It's an experience, an amalgamation of moments, not some deciding force. Is it not enough to say that this feels important or significant to me and thus I choose to do it on my own accord instead of doing it to meet life's demands?\nAgain, I don't fully grasp what he means and thus may be missing the mark. What can I take from this chapter? There is a quotation that resonates with me:\n\n\"It is never the case that there's no next step to take. On some level, I think we always already know when we're hiding out in some domain of life, flinching from a challenge reality has placed before us. The purpose of a question like 'What's the life task here?' is just to haul that knowledge up into the daylight of consciousness, when we can finally do something about it.\"\n\nThat makes sense. It encourages me to stop frequently and reflect on life instead of just staying still in a comfort zone. There's a step to take. Reflecting helps me see what it is.\n\nDay 11\nFear often pervades life. As Burkeman points out, it can be as little as fearing to check your email because there might be an email from someone impatient that you haven't replied. Unhelpful fears can consume our finite energy and finite time, preventing us from living the life we want.\n\n\"The more you organize your life around not addressing the things that make you anxious, the more likely they are to develop into serious problems -- and even if they don't, the longer you fail the confront them, the more unhappy time you spend scared of what might be lurking in the places you don't want to go.\"\n\nA common piece of wisdom is to confront your fears head on. Take action! That creates another kind of adversarial relationship with the fear. We go from cowering from the fear to attacking it. Burkeman suggests a gentler approach: befriend your fear.\n\n\"Everyone has an assortment of not-yet-begun or not-yet-completed projects that would benefit from their attention, because that's the nature of being a finite human. But there's no need for them to torment you. Once you've established a relationship with them, they become white sheep, and just patiently wait their turn.\"\n\nHow do you become friends with your fear? Observe them with curiosity. Don't cower in fear. Don't strategize a way of confronting the fear. Don't break the task into smaller pieces to make the fear more palatable. Simply sit with it. It'll be uncomfortable at first. Where do you feel the fear in your body? Is it in your chest, tense shoulders, furrowed brow? Once you've experienced it, you can become more curious about its origins and why it has gripped you. This is not in the aim to solve it, only to understand it. You're empathizing with it like you would a friend in anguish. Listen to what it tells you. Emotions like fear educate us about our deep desires and patterns.\nOnce you're friends with the fear, you won't consider hiding or vanquishing it. When it arises again, you'll go speak to it again. Then, together you can resolve the situation at hand. You can check your email calmly, prepared for whatever you find.\n\nDay 12\n\n\"The unstated appeal of a lot of productivity advice [...] lies in the bewitching idea that there might a rule, or a set of rules, that would force accomplishment to occur, rendering it inevitable and automatic. We yearn for such a rule, not generally because we're lazy, but because we don't fully trust ourselves to get the right things done without one.\"\n\nEven a rule as simple as marking an 'x' on the calendar each day we complete a goal is a fantasy conjured up to will us into productivity. I think there's nothing wrong with tracking your progress so you can have some kind of accountability, but the purpose of the 'x' is different then. The rules we use should be carefully considered instead of blindly adopted from self-help books. Then, they should be reconsidered as our practices and life situations evolve. The 'x' could be the solution for you if the regular recognition of a step towards your goal propels you forward. It isn't for you if you flog yourself every time you make a mistake and miss a day.\nRules and practices are tools to help reach our goals, not to solve everything.\n\nDay 13\n\n\"If you're a 'knowledge worker' [...] then you'll make the most progress, and cover the most ground, if you limit yourself to about three or four hours of intense mental focus each day.\"\n\nThis sounds wonderful but I don't see how it's feasible with my current work load.\n\n\"The most powerful effect of the rule, though, might be the way in which it limits the possibility of hurry.

We'll use the Hipparcos catalog.\n\nI recommend saving this as a CSV file and then opening it as needed instead of downloading it every time.\n\nFiltering for relevant stars\nThere are a lot of stars in this catalog. We may only want to show up to a certain magnitude.\nFiltering on Pandas dataframes is easy though.\n\nIn addition, not all the stars will be visible in our image.\nA world coordinate system or WCS describes where an image is in the sky.\nWe'll use it to determine the pixel coordinates of each star and then throw away those outside the frame.\n\n\nMaking the actual star image\nFinally, we can write a straightforward function to make a star field.\nIt'll use all our other work until now.\nWe provide it with a wcs, the dimensions of an image (img_shape), and the full-width-half-maximum (fwhm) of our Gaussian PSF for stars.\nThere are a few other helpful parameters here too.\nFor example, mag_set and flux_set work together to scale the star brightnesses.\nIf mag_set=0 and flux_set=500_000 then stars with magnitude 0 in the catalo will have a flux value of 500_000.\nAll other magnitude stars are scaled accordingly.\nWe also sometimes want to add noise. We can currently add a Gaussian noise with mean of noise_mean and standard deviation of noise_std.\nIf these parameters are set to None, then no noise is added.\nFinally, we can control the dimmest_magnitude to limit what magnitude stars are shown. The more stars you show, the slower the code is.\n\nSo let's run it!\n\nAnd visualize it.\n\n\nNote that our WCS here is rather simple, but we could have added a distortion model too and that would've been applied.\nBe careful to set wcs_mode=all in that case.\n\nConlusions\nThis makes a rather convincing initial star field.

I was unfamiliar with this work, but\nit makes a lot of sense to me. I want to think more critically about how I approach creativity in my work,\nnot so I can get more done but to enjoy the creation process more completely.\n\nThe Classic Four Stages\nIt seems everyone agrees there are at least four stages to the creative process. These were proposed by Graham Wallas in his book The Art of Thought. Some people divide them up\na bit differently, adding more or reorganizing the process. I like this figure from Geeks for Geeks that shows the\nmost commonly accepted four stages because it emphasizes that they aren't always in order and can be repeated when\ncreating. But, it's easiest to conceptualize by moving in a linear fashion.\n\n\n1. Preparation\nCreative work almost always begins with the preparation stage and will\nlikely return to it multiple times before completion. In the preparation\nstage, we ponder the problem deeply and learn as much about it as we can.\nThis is when we're scouring books or reading blog posts. It involves\npotentially decades of experience honing your craft. It's an interactive phase of taking notes and thinking very hard about the\ncreative task at hand. This stage is often overlooked in retellings of\ngenius but it's always there.\n\n2. Incubation\nI've noticed in my work that I often need to take a break after the\npreparation stage. It turns out that's pretty common. We have to let\nthe ideas explored in the first step incubate and grow. This is a\nmore passive stage where we let our subconscious brains continue working\nwhile we do other things. Maybe as short as taking a walk or as long as stepping back from the creative task for a few weeks.\nRecognizing and embracing this stage avoids burnout and frustration.\nBreaks are essential to the creative process.\n\n3. Illumination\nAfter we've let an idea incubate, there could be a sudden \"eureka moment\"\nor a slow realization of the best approach. Either way, that's illumination. It's when we piece together the work into something that\nmakes sense or has a cohesive structure. We try out ideas that come to us.\n\n4. Verification\n\"Eureka moments\" can be wrong or misleading. It takes many incorrect solutions or ideas to get to the one that works.\nIn the verification stage, we evaluate the results of illumination given\nthe preparation we've done. We revise and modify the idea to see if it truly fits.\n\nRepeat\nOne go around of this creative process doesn't always result in a great work. For example, writing a book will require repeating the process many times: for each chapter, for each page, for each sentence. We might spend more time in some stages than others depending on the creative task. We might skip some steps altogether sometimes.\n\nIncorporating the steps into my work\nDifferent people will excel at different stages of the work. I find I get energized by new ideas during illumination or preparation but it can be challenging to revise them during verification. In addition, I can forget that incubation is critical and push myself so hard I miss great solutions. Projects require people who have strengths in different parts of the process.\n\nQuestions on which to reflect\n\nWhat part of the process am I on right now in this creative task?\nWould more preparation or incubation help me in this work?\nAm I clinging too much to an idea and missing others?\nWho can I talk to about this work to get more perspective?\nAm I avoiding the task of verifying? It can be a challenge to revise your own work.\nAm I rushing the process?\n\n\nNext steps\nI'm going to read Wallas's The Art of Thought (assuming it isn't too technical) and see what more I can learn about the creative process. It might be nice to look for related texts that emphasize these ideas in the context of software development or scientific research since those are most relevant to me.\n","description":"","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/stages-of-creativity/","path":"/blog/stages-of-creativity/","title":"Harnessing the stages of creativity for better work"},"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/standup-parking-lots/":{"body":"A stand up is a short daily meeting for a team to discuss work progress, work plans, and impediments to converting plans into progress.\nThey are a mainstay of agile development and often are structured so each team member reports on three things:\n\nWhat did I accomplish recently?\nWhat will I accomplish next?\nAre there impediments that could block my accomplishments?\n\nThere is an emphasis on short so that they do not distract from actual progress.

Some misunderstood Problem 3 and tried proving something completely different than intended.&nbsp;After 15 minutes, they traded papers (with anonymous codes instead of their names so there was no embarrassment) and reviewed each someone else's papers as we went over them in class. They wrote some lovely, encouraging comments to each other. For example, one student had no idea of what to do on the second problem so they left it blank and their reviewer wrote, \"Bet you can do it now! :D.\" Others noted where the proof failed and wrote a comment that they too had that difficulty. It's refreshing to see such kindness. Finally, they took the same survey about their proof writing again and there were dramatic changes in confidence.\n\nMany more students were confident in their abilities. I'm not sure who the one who reported 1 after the exercise is. I hope they come to office hours.\nThis is in no way a rigorous test, but students expressed they learned more from this exercise because it forced them to think about the material instead of just going through the proof together on the board. I imagine there is a psychological benefit of seeing how someone else is doing too and being kind to them in written comments. It was also suggested that I do a problem example in class without proving it before class so students could hear my raw thought process first hand. I'll have to think about that.

Now, prove that and derive formulas (or prove it's not possible) for a generalized version.\nOther ideas:\n\nHow does the total cell count formula change depending on the starting configuration, e.g. more than one active cell?\nAre there interesting stochastic versions?\nWhat happens when cells have a regeneration period, a time after they die before they can activate again? That models disease and other phenomena better maybe since resources/population has to restore before a new outbreak is successful.\nWhat if the age of a cell is a function of its position on the plane?\nCan we generalize to other grid types?\nHow does this fit into other work? Has it already been done?\n\nThis whole curiosity partially started because I wanted to assign a simple proof about Ulam-Warburton to my summer discrete math class. I also have an affinity for fractals, who doesn't?\n","description":"","id":"https://jmbhughes.com/blog/ulam-warburton/","path":"/blog/ulam-warburton/","title":"Ulam–Warburton automaton
