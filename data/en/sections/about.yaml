# a summary about you
summary: "I am a computer scientist with 5+ years of experience.
I'm interested in software applications in solar physics, including machine learning.
Currently, I'm working on building the [data reduction pipeline for
PUNCH](https://github.com/punch-mission). This will help scientists resolve
mysteries about the solar corona and solar wind. In my spare time, I like photography,
reading, sculpting with polymer clay, journaling, and many more things."
