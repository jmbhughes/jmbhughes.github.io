# a summary about you
summary: "I am a computer scientist with five years of experience.
I'm interested in software applications in solar physics, including machine learning.
Currently, I'm working on building the data reduction pipeline for
[PUNCH](https://punch.space.swri.edu/). This will help scientists resolve
mysteries about the solar corona and solar wind. In my spare time, I like photography,
reading, sculpting with polymer clay, and many more things. I'm growing a
[digital garden](https://arbor.jmbhughes.com). Check it out to explore my second brain."
